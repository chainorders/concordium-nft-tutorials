# Interaction with Concordium Smart Contracts

`mint-ui` is a React based frontend DAPP. It interacts with the deployed on-chain cis2-multi contracts. To allow a user to

- Initialize a new instance of CIS2-Multi Contract

## Setup

- Install [Concordium chrome extension wallet](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-browser-wallet/tree/main/packages/browser-wallet).

  - `MULTI_CONTRACT_SCHEMA` : HEX string of `schema.bin` file got from compilation of rust code of cis2-multi

## Deploy

However [node-cli](https://github.com/chainorders/concordium-contracts-node-cli) and [concordium client](https://github.com/chainorders/concordium-contracts/tree/main/concordium-client) can be used to deploy contracts
